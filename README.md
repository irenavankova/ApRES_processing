# ApRES_processing

A series of scripts that can be used to process ApRES data. The outputs are
 
* complex signal as a function of range for each shot (standard processing)
* displacement time series for each range (for a specified bin width)
* displacement time series of the basal reflector (using 2 different techniques)

Instructions are in the following:
ct_processing_sequence_V4.m
